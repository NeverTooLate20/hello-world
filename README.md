Learning...following tutorial
I am on furlough from work due to COVID-19 and I am excited about using the time to retake Harvard EDx CS50's Intro to Computer Science class. 
I had started to take it previously many years ago, and didn't have the time to continue/complete it. I have always wanted to find the time to get back to this and learn more about computer science.
