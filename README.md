Learning...following tutorial
I am restarting the Harvard CS50X intro to computer science class. I am determined to finish it during a furlough from work due to COVID-19.  I am excited about finally getting this done, learning new skills which help make me more effective at my job and have been wanting to do it for a very long time. :)
